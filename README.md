The Night Seen is a collaboration between my partners and I to build a nightlife digest that allows users to view the most up to date information possible before they decide to go to bars and clubs. Inspired by the live surf cameras used by surfline.com.

Currently we are building out the code required to run the Wowza server as well as talking to local businesses to gain more hosted cameras in the Washington D.C. metro area.

This project runs on a LAMP stack, is written in Laravel, styled with Bootstrap and utilizes jQuery AJAX throughout.
